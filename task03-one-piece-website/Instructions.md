* Use this Figma project to obtain the site assets and guidelines.
* Just develop the HOME page.
* Please check the Components and Styles pages.
* The site must be responsive, and the development process must be mobile-first. It means you must create the mobile, tablet and website versions of the home page.
* The assets can be found in GDrive / AKUREY / Trainings / Tech / Web / 2. Self-Control / One Piece Website / svg.
* SASS must be used as a styling pre-processor.
* Icons such as hamburger menus and magnifying glasses must come from an icon font. IconMoon, Fontastic or Material Design can be used for font generation.
* Use Atomic Design to create the components.
* You can use Bootstrap to handle the design layout between devices.
flexbox can be used to reduce development time.
* The site must be functional for Chrome and Firefox, and the presentation of the elements must be identical on all browsers.
* Use gulp or any other task manager to locally run the project.
* The project must be “Pixel Perfect”. It means colors, styles, design, and fonts cannot be changed.
* The magic is in the details: pay special attention to them. For example:
- Mobile, you have:
-- a hamburger menu.
-- a full-width hero image.
-- a defined left & right margin for the content.
-- …
- Tablet:
-- the Synopsis box has a different position.
-- …
- Desktop, you have
-- top menu
-- hero image & synopsis boxes have a different layout
-- … 
* At this point you don’t have to worry about the JS behaviors, like:
- “Search” functionality.
- Switch Language functionality.
* You must develop the hamburger menu (mobile & tablet) behavior.
* You must develop the Synopsis’ “Read All” button functionality.
* This are the URLs of the menu anchors:
- Home: /
-Characters: /characters
- Islands: /islands
- Mist Objects: /mist-objects
* The “See all” anchors drive to the page following the structure of the previous point.
